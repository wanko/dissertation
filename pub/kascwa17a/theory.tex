\label{sec:theory}

This section provides the fundamental concepts for extending \clingo{} with theory-specific reasoning.
We begin by showing how its input language can be customized with theory-specific constructs.
We then sketch \clingo's algorithmic approach to ASP solving with theory propagation
in order to put the following description of \clingo's theory reasoning interface on firm grounds.
The below material is an abridged version of~\cite{gekakaosscwa16a}.
