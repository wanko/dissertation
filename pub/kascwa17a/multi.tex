\section{Multi-shot ASP solving}
\label{sec:multi}

Let us begin with an informal overview of the central features and language constructs of \clingo's multi-shot solving capacities.
We illustrate them in the two following sections by implementing two exemplary reasoning modes, namely branch-and-bound-based optimization and incremental ASP solving.
The material in Section~\ref{sec:glance} and~\ref{sec:iclingo} is borrowed from~\cite{gekakasc14b} and~\cite{gekaobsc15a}, respectively,
where more detailed accounts can be found.
