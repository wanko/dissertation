The recent series~5 of the ASP system \clingo{} provides generic means to enhance basic Answer Set Programming (ASP)
with theory reasoning capabilities.
We instantiate this framework with different forms of linear constraints and elaborate upon its formal properties.
Given this, we discuss the respective implementations,
and present techniques for using these constraints in a reactive context.
%and conduct an experimental analysis with related systems.
More precisely,
we introduce extensions to \clingo{} with
difference and linear constraints over integers and reals, respectively, 
and realize them in complementary ways.
Finally, 
we empirically evaluate the resulting \clingo{} derivatives \clingod{dl} and \clingod{lp} on common language fragments and contrast them to related ASP systems.
