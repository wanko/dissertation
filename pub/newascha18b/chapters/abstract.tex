%	The design space for highly complex system level specifications of embedded systems is enormous as tasks may be mapped to different resources and messages may be routed over several links of the hardware platform. 
%	Furthermore, highly constrained requirements lead to many infeasible solutions that have to be sorted out. \emph{\ac{ASP}} in combination with variant background theories (\emph{\ac{ASPmT}}) has been shown to cope with such requirements very efficiently. However, especially in system level design, a fast \emph{\ac{DSE}} including optimization is crucial in order to steer the development towards optimal design points. In this paper, we therefore propose to couple the highly efficient constraint solving capabilities of \ac{ASP} with a \ac{DSE} including \emph{multi-objective optimization} in an additional background theory. Utilizing the possibility to work on \emph{partial assignments}, \ac{ASPmT} is able to prune entire infeasible and dominated regions from the search space early in the decision process. In the experimental section, we present and compare variant approaches and domain specific heuristics.

\begin{abstract}
	An efficient \emph{\ac{DSE}} is imperative for the design of modern, highly complex embedded systems in order to steer the development towards optimal design points. The early evaluation of design decisions at system-level abstraction layer helps to find promising regions for subsequent development steps in lower abstraction levels by diminishing the complexity of the search problem. In recent works, symbolic techniques, especially \ac{ASPmT}, have been shown to find feasible solutions of highly complex system-level synthesis problems with non-linear constraints very efficiently. In this paper, we present a novel approach to a holistic system-level \ac{DSE} based on \ac{ASPmT}. To this end, we include additional background theories that concurrently guarantee compliance with hard constraints and perform the simultaneous optimization of several design objectives. %First experimental results show the applicability of our approach. %for large optimization of up to 170 tasks mapped to 3-dimensional hardware platforms. Furthermore, it outperforms current multi-objective optimization strategies of \ac{ASP} with respect to both diversity and convergence of found solutions.   %We present and investigate several strategies that show the applicability of our approach even for large problem instances. 
	We implement and compare our approach with a state-of-the-art preference handling framework for \ac{ASP}. Experimental results indicate that our proposed method produces better solutions with respect to both diversity and convergence to the true Pareto front.
