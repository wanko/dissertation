\section{Conclusion}
%\blindtext\blindtext
In this paper, we have presented a design space exploration framework that extends the preference handling capabilities of the \acf{ASP} solver \clingo\ towards multi-objective optimization of non-linear constraints. To this end, we utilized background theory solving to execute the search for novel solutions as well as the constraint solving of non-linear constraints. We presented and implemented three different search strategies to perform the design space exploration. The experimental results indicate that a combination of a simple exploration model and a concurrent search of multiple regions in the objective space delivers the best results with respect to convergence and diversity of the found non-dominated solutions. \par
%For future work, we will extend the framework towards under-approximation capabilities and investigate how it can be used to steer the solver into more diverse regions of the feasible objective space.
