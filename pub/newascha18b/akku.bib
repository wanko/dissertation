  ABSTRACT =	 "From 1966 through 1972, the Artificial Intelligence Center at SRI conducted research on a mobile robot system nicknamed
                  ``Shakey. Endowed with a limited ability to perceive and model its environment, Shakey could perform tasks that required
                  planning, route-finding, and the rearranging of simple objects. Although the Shakey project led to numerous advances in AI
                  techniques, many of which were reported in the literature, much specific information that might be useful in current robotics
                  research appears only in a series of relatively inaccessible SRI technical reports. Our purpose here, consequently, is to make this
                  material more readily available by extracting and reprinting those sections of the reports that seem particularly interesting,
                  relevant and important."
