  - verify!
  - [ ] neutral vs effective domain choices

  - instances too easy
    - only 3/22 > 10 secs
  - single timeout makes average climb to 22 :(
  - no domain choices when doing 'init' ???
    - same for actions and fluents
    - init32 is bizarre (presumbly because it solves the single timeout)
    - no domain choices for ordered 'init' as well
* refactoring
  - what is counted in terms of choices
* BUGS
