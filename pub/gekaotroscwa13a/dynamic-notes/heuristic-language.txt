                                           HCLASP LANGUAGE SUMMARY
===========================================================================
 
 
Three main options:

        1. formalize only the simplest useful thing: 
             _heuristic(a,true,10).
       and present the rest as other options not formalized
           good points:
             - simple
                 - useful 
                 - clear semantics for the static case (circumscription)
                 - heuristic independent
           bad points: 
             - hclasp allows to do more, and it may be important

        2. formalize current hclasp adding dynamic behavior for factor option:
           good points:
             - what we intuitively have done
                 - improved over vsids in many cases (philipp thesis)
           bad points: 
             - more complicated: f.e., factor affects the heuristic scoring
                 
        3. formalize a heuristic language that models completely the heuristic
           good: power to the programmer
           bad: mess to the programmer, too much to begin with, we dont know how to go with it
           
           
Semantics:
        Static case for _heuristic(a,true,10) corresponds to circumscription
        Dynamic case semantics are dependent on the solving algorithm, so right now: no way
        
        
Conflict between _heuristic atoms:
        1. Let the user define some function to solve those situations, or add some command line option...
        2. Two main ideas: get the value that has higher absolute value (so that negative info is accepted)
                           or get the latest value (so that it is veryvery dynamic)


 ===========================================================================
                                                        HCLASP LANGUAGE
===========================================================================
 
Properties of a good language:
- heuristic independent: i.e., should work with vsids and berkmin
- static is a special case of dynamic
- semantic counterpart: i.e., circumscription in the static case
- simple
- powerful: good results with it

Hclasp options:
  _heuristic(a,true|false|any,X) [dynamic]
  _heuristic(a,level,X)
  _heuristic(a,fix_sign,X)
  _heuristic(a,def_sign,X)
  _heuristic(a,init,X)
  _heuristic(a,factor,X)
  
Notes: in the static case
  level = any 
  level and fix_sign = true|false

Most basic language that works:
  _heuristic(a,true|false,X)
Satisfies all conditions:
  - heuristic independent: although now it is implemented in vsids, could be (and should be) used by any clasp heuristic
  - static is special case
  - semantic counterpart in static case is circumscription
  - simple
  - powerful: pddl, bw in asp, hanoi in asp, mailbot in asp...  
BUT has not all possibilities of hclasp:
  - def_sign
  - init 
  - factor
    
Most complex language = total control over the heuristic 

note: if static is prioritized circumscruiption (McCarthy) i think we should call levels, priorities.  
  
  
====================================
 CONFLICTS BETWEEN _heuristic ATOMS
====================================

Simplest case: true|false|any and positive priorities
-----------------------------------------------------

  We have _heuristic(a,V,10) and _heuristic(a,V',20)
    where V and V' may be true, false, or any
  what _heuristic atom should we take into account?

Options:
  - the highest priority: makes sense with the basic case, where _heuristic atoms point to
                          different atoms
  - the lowest priority: no sense, contradictory with basic case where _heuristic atoms 
                         correspond to different variables
  - the latest: makes sense, as you progress in the search you have more information and 
                you may thus update your heuristic  
  - the first: against the dynamic idea

SO: 
  - either take the highest or latest priority
    right now this has not been a problem, 
        because i havent had conflicts, but these may appear
  - i think both possibilities shoulb be easily available, 
    and if this is not relevant for the experiments (as in the current case)
        in the paper should go the simplest one
  - note that:
    * choosing the latest is dependent on the order of the unit propagations
        * choosing the highest is really simple to explain and formalize

        
Negative priorities
-------------------

Could be interesting in some cases:
- in philipp experiments it improved vsids in solitaire, 
  although level descending was better
  
Properties of a good approach: 
- symmetry with positive priorities, 
  i.e. if you set the priority of a to -2 
  and then comes something that sets it to -4
  you should set it to -4 as you would do if you had 2 and later 4

Previous approaches: 
- get the last: works straightforwardly
- get the highest: then, how would you move it to less thatn 0?
    (1) move it to less than 0 if it was 0, else, get the highest: not intuitive, not symmetrical!
        (2) get the highest absolute value:
              if you have -4 -2 3, then priority is 3
                  else if you have -2 4 67, then priority is 67
Both (get-the-last and get-the-highest-absolute) seem ok.

Note: 
      negative priorities with get-the-last method can be simulated by positive priorities, 
      setting at start all atoms at a positive priority, e.g., 1000, 
      and afterwards setting some of them to a lower value
          
          however, get-the-highest cannot be simulated that way, because we would always get the highest priority!
                  

Note with negative priorities:
- no case of use for the paper
- complicates a bit, but just a bit
                  
        
SEMANTICS
=========

true|false|any in the static case correspond to circumscription

In the dynamic case there is a problem to give a semantic interpretation.
Consider program P:
        {a,b}.
        :- a, b.
        c :- b.
        c :- not b.
        _heuristic(a,true,1).
        _heuristic(b,true,10) :- c.
Hclasp would run:
        UnitPropagate: _heuristic(a,true,1)
        Decide:            a
        UP:            -b c _heuristic(b,true,10)
Now consider that Hclasp also can do some reasoning by cases, 
that allows it to propagate c at start given that either b or not b will be true in any answer set:
    NewPropagation: _heuristic(a,true,1) c _heuristic(b,true,10)
        Decide:         b
        NewPropagation: -a
SO:
The answer set that is selected depends on the propagation method of the solver!
Note that this is not the case in the static case.

def_sign, init and factor affect the heuristic scoring and i see
no way to give them semantic interpretation, 
and their effect is heuristic dependent.


SIMPLEST OPTION
===============

In the paper, present true|false only:
- this satisfies all previous conditions, specially, it is simple and clear
- even without negative priorities
  note: _heuristic(a,any,3) is equivalent to _heuristic(a,true,3) and _heuristic(a,false,3)


* specify this formally, as:
  Decide(M) = { l | l, -l \notin M, and either max(M)=0 or 
                    \exists _heuristic(l,true,max(M)) or 
                    \exists _heuristic(-l,false,max(M) } 
  where max(M) = max({0} \cup { P | _heuristic(A,V,P) \in M, and A, -A \notin M } )

* to use the get-last method it becomes a bit more involved
* some more changes would be needed for negative priorities

Then, in an extensions section, specify other options that are included:
 - negative priorities:
    * simply say: and we allow negative, that works bla, bla...
 - get-last option:
    * by command line or adding fact _heuristic(get_last)
 - def_sign
 - init
 - factor:
    * as in hclasp, or, for simplicity
          we can add option --factor that makes hclasp consider _heuristic atoms
          refering to the factor and not to the priority, so that we keep the language simple...
 NOTE: all these require to refer to the heuristic scoring to be specified

More options (these shouldnt go in the paper, just future ideas):
- combine vsids with domain:
  --combine=0.4 
    with probability 0.4 choose the best vsids variable independently of the domain score
  --onrestart=0.1
    start using vsids with probability 0, and use it with probability 0.1 after first restart, 
    0.2 after second restart... (this could work to move to vsids to prove unsat on difficult instances, 
    and use somain on simple ones)
  --onconflicts=10000,0.1
    at each restart init vsids to probability 0, 
    and use it with probability 0.1 after 10000 conflicts, then with probability 0.2 after 20000 conflicts, etc...
  PROBLEM: HOW TO IMPLEMENT THIS, FAST?
        
=====================================================
                                CURRENT LANGUAGE
=====================================================   

We may model a heuristic using a pair of functions Score and Sign:
        Score: Assignment x Variable -> [0,1]
        Sign:  Assignment x Variable -> {-1,1}
So that for each partial assignment the functions give a score and a sign to each variable.
Note: really this is not a correct description, in the sense that the heuristic values maybe do not 
      depend on the current partial assignment, as in vsids
But: it is enough for presentation purposes, i would say.

So, we can define the heuristic as follows:
        H(M) = { a | a is a free atom, not exists x free s.t. Score(M,x) > Score(M,a), and Sign(M,a)=1 } \cup   
               { l | l = -a, a is a free atom, not exists x free s.t. Score(M,x) > Score(M,a), and Sign(M,a)=-1 } % this could be made simpler

Now we add these values for each variable:
  fix_sign:  -1 0 1
  level:     -int...+int 
  factor:    -int...+int (in hclasp really this is a double, but maybe for simplicity we could present it as integer)
They are 0 by default:
  H(M) = { a | a is a free atom, not exists x free s.t. 
               level(M,x)>level(M,a) or (level(M,x)=level(M,a) and factor(M,x)*Score(M,x) > factor(M,a)*Score(M,a)), and 
               ( fix_sign(M,a)=1 or (fix_sign(M,a)=0 and Sign(M,a)=1) ) } \union   
         { l | l = -a, a is an atom, not exists x free s.t. 
               level(M,x)>level(M,a) or (level(M,x)=level(M,a) and factor(M,x)*Score(M,x) > factor(M,a)*Score(M,a)), and 
               ( fix_sign(M,a)=-1 or (fix_sign(M,a)=0 and Sign(M,a)=-1) ) } 

We have to define the functions fix_sign, level and factor.  
  level(M,x) = #op{ P | P = 0 or _heuristic(x,true,P) is in M or _heuristic(-x,false,P) is in M }       
  factor(M,x) = #op{ P | _heuristic(x,factor,P) is in M }       
  fix_sign(M,x) = { 1 if _heuristic(x,true,level(M,x)) is in M, else -1 if _heuristic(x,false,level(M,x)) is in M, else 0 }     
Where #op may be the maximum value, for example.




=====================================================
         TOTAL LANGUAGE FOR THE HEURISTIC
=====================================================
        
Vsids has the following information for each variable:
        - activity
        - occurrence
It picks the free variable with the highest activity, 
with a polarity that depends on the value of occurrence, 
and with a default polarity in case occurrence equals 0.
SO: activity determines the variable chosen
    occurrence determines the sign of the variable
        
Hclasp additions:
 - level
 - factor
 - fix_sign
 - def_sign
 - init

So, for each variable we have this data:
        - activity
        - level
        - factor
        - occurrence
        - fix_sign
        - def_sign

Note: 
* init is not a value that we mantain, 
  it is something that was just true at start

  
choose FREE variable 
  of the highest LEVEL  
        with the highest FACTOR*ACTIVITY
      and FIX_SIGN else OCCURRENCE else DEF_SIGN        

[ really it is not exactly this way, because DEF_SIGN is only used if there is no FIX_SIGN, 
  occurrence==0 and there is no saved sign ]

We could skip def_sign, we havent taken advantage of it, and it only makes things more complicated.
This way, we can skip occurrence, and allow it only to be modified by fix_sign: 1=true, -1=false, 0=vsids chooses as wants.
SO we would have:
  activity
  level
  factor
  fix_sign

choose FREE variable
  of the highest LEVEL
    with the highest FACTOR*ACTIVITY
      and FIX_SIGN else vsids-choice
  
to say free we need to be able to refer to the value in the current partial assignment, 
and this may be good to refer to undefined variables:
  value:    -1 0 1
  fix_sign: -1 0 1  (neg,undef,pos)
  score (more general name than activity, which is vsids)
  level: -int...+int
  factor
We should give a general value to the score
It would be good if score, level and factor had the same type.
But: keep it easy:
  value:    -1 0 1
  fix_sign: -1 0 1
  score:     0...1       (double)
  level:     -int...+int (integer)      
  factor:    -int...+int
Really score and value, we cannot touch, so we only can modify:
    fix_sign:        set to -1, 0 or 1
    level,factor:    set to -int..+int
  to simplify, we can consider fix_sign, also 
    -int...+int 
  and then if it is <=-1 it is negative, and if it is >=1 it is positive
  
  
And we have a general language that is: 
иииииииииииииииииииииииииииииииииииииии

        _heuristic(
                property*(a,value),
                if(property(b),op,value)
        )

        or maybe _heuristic(set(property*(a),value),if(property(b),op,value))
        
    properties are: value, score, sign, level, factor
        and only sign, level and factor can be modified (property*)
        op is: <, <=, =, >=, >
        
Example:
        _heuristic(level(holds(F,T),T),sign(holds(F,T),1)) :- holds(F,T1), next(T,T1).
    _heuristic(level(a,5),sign(a,-1),if(level(a,<=,5)))           :- body.   
 
This way _heuristic atoms are applied as they become true, 
and with ifs you can control whether it is executed or not at that moment.
Problem1: an if condition is false at unitpropagation, but becomes true afterwards 
          (maybe even in the same unitpropagation step), what should we do? 
          mmm... too complex, seems...
Problem2: you refer to score(a,=,0) to say that a is undefined at that time step,
          and it is and you modify the priority of the corresponding variable, 
                  what do you do if afterwards a becomes assigned? (f.e., in the same unitpropagation?)
 
Simple Solution: you just apply the property* changes if the conditions are satisfied, 
                 and when the atom is backjumped, you undo them
