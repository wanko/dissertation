Hola!

I have the Local Search framework running, pretty simple thing.
It goes slower than clasp, but i think it is enough for testing the idea,
let's see...

I am running it with:
  $ python local.py l.queens.lp
In local.py it is explained a bit how to use it.
The idea is that everything is specified in asp in the l.queens.lp.

Chao!
Javier
