We thank all reviewers for their very fair and instructive assessment of our paper.

We agree with most of the criticism but we had to make compromises on what to detail 
in view of space limitations and the "ground breaking" nature of the work giving rise
to many new research questions.

We are grateful for the indicated literature and will take it into account when revising the paper.

The systematic study of the capacity of the proposed heuristic language is subject
to ongoing research.  
A primary role of the language is to offer a means for expressing heuristics.
The invention of a heuristics is similar to algorithm configuration.
Accordingly, we currently obtain the best results either by good domain knowledge 
or using automatic configurators, like ParamILS or SMAC.

We agree with R2 on the overly bold claim on making special-purpose implementations obsolete 
and will relativize it when revising the paper.

We have refrained from exploring the highly sophisticated language fragments mentioned by R3 
in favor of a more pragmatic fragment, for which we can provide (obvious) guarantees.

clasp supports lookahead but we have not explored its usage in this context.

GOLOG provides domain knowledge eliminating undesirable solutions.
This can be combined but not expressed by domain heuristics.

Columns 2 and 3 of Table 3 cover SAT and UNSAT instances; columns 4 and 5 show
only successful, ie SAT instances.

Again, thank you for the constructive reviews.
