Many computational and mathematical methods have thus been developed to model the response of such systems
to external perturbations, and applied to well-studied organisms~cite{barzol04a,joypal06a,yambor09a}.

The reactions are chosen to optimize either   graph-based criteria~cite{haebhe05a} or a linear
score modeling the quantitative production of the system~%, based on linear programming approaches
cite{satish\_kumar\_optimization\_2007}.
\item  \comment{copied - still interesting?}
The main limitation of all approaches is the increasing size of the search space, since reaction % knowledge 
databases 
like 
% -- such as 
KEGG\footnote{\texttt{\url{http://www.genome.jp/kegg}}} or MetaCyc\footnote{\texttt{\url{http://metacyc.org}}} % -- 
have substantially grown % up 
with
the availability of high-throughput methods in molecular biology. 
Other studies propose to overcome this limitation by using sampling
heuristics~cite{christian\_integrative\_2009}, but unfortunately they give little information on the size of
solution sets and the quality of the sampling methods.
