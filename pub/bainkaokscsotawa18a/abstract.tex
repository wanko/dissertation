Answer Set Programming (ASP) is an approach to declarative problem
solving, combining a rich yet simple modeling language with high
performance solving capacities.
%
We here develop an ASP-based approach to
\textit{Curriculum-Based Course Timetabling} (CB-CTT),
one of the most widely studied course timetabling problems.
The resulting {\asap} system reads a CB-CTT instance 
of a standard input format and converts it into a set of ASP facts.
In turn, these facts are combined with a first-order encoding for CB-CTT solving, 
which can subsequently be solved by any off-the-shelf ASP systems.
%
We establish the competitiveness of our approach by empirically
contrasting it to the best known bounds obtained so far via
dedicated implementations. 
%
Furthermore, we extend the {\asap} system to multi-objective course timetabling
and consider \textit{minimal perturbation problems}.
