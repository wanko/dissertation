  Abstract                 = {SAT (Boolean satisfiability) has become the primary Boolean reasoning engine for many EDA (electronic design automation) applications, so the efficiency of SAT-solving is of great practical importance. B-cubing is our extension and generalization of Goldberg et al.'s supercubing, an approach to pruning in SAT-solving completely different from the standard approach used in leading solvers. We have built a B-cubing-based solver that is competitive with, and often outperforms, leading conventional solvers (e.g., ZChaff II) on a wide range of EDA benchmarks. However, B-cubing is hard to understand and even the correctness of the algorithm is not obvious. This paper presents the theoretical basis for B-cubing, proves our approach correct, details our implementation and experimental results, and maps out other correct possibilities for further improving SAT-solving},

  Abstract                 = {The currentmonolithic and lengthy scheme behind the standardization and the design of new video coding standards is becoming inappropriate to satisfy the dynamism and changing needs of the video coding community. Such a scheme and specification formalism do not enable designers to exploit the clear commonalities between the different codecs, neither at the level of the specification nor at the level of the implementation. Such a problem is one of the main reasons for the typical long time interval elapsing between the time a new idea is validated until it is implemented in consumer products as part of a worldwide standard. The analysis of this problem originated a new standard initiative within the ISO/IEC MPEG committee, called Reconfigurable Video Coding (RVC). The main idea is to develop a video coding standard that overcomes many shortcomings of the current standardization and specification process by updating and progressively incrementing a modular library of components. As the name implies, flexibility and reconfigurability are new attractive features of the RVC standard. The RVC framework is based on the usage of a new actor/dataflow oriented language called CAL for the specification of the standard library and the instantiation of the RVC decoder model. CAL dataflow models expose the intrinsic concurrency of the algorithms by employing the notions of actor programming and dataflow. This chapter gives an overview of the concepts and technologies building the standard RVC framework and the non standard tools supporting the RVC model from the instantiation and simulation of the CAL model to the software and/or hardware code synthesis.},

  Abstract                 = {Future embedded real-time systems require more performance to fulfill customer demands. Many-core architectures implementing a network-on-chip (NoC) are proposed as scalable solutions. Software execution on such many-core architectures requires fundamental design decisions: spatial binding of software components to processing elements, multi-hop transaction routing, and scheduling for shared resources. Amongst others, respecting intrinsic many-core platform properties like non-uniform memory access (NUMA) and contention on the NoC is crucial. As a remedy, we introduce a formal model as key enabler for the system-level decision making process for embedded control applications. Thereby, the system model allows for a correct-by-construction decision making approach. In this paper, we propose to exploit answer set programming (ASP) to compute spatial bindings and multi-hop routes for communication, combined with a satisfiability modulo theories (SMT) solver providing scheduling decisions. Further, we present the dedicated ASP encoding and early experimental results. In the context of related work, we then highlight directions to further pursue the proposed approach.},

  Abstract                 = {In this paper, we present a novel model enabling system-level decision making for time-triggered many-core architectures in automotive systems. The proposed application model includes shared data entities that need to be bound to memories during decision making. As a key enabler to our approach, we explicitly separate computation and shared memory communication over a network-on-chip (NoC). To deal with contention on a NoC, we model the necessary basis to implement a time-triggered schedule that guarantees freedom of interference. We compute fundamental design decisions, namely (a) spatial binding, (b) multi-hop routing, and (c) time-triggered scheduling, by a novel coupling of answer set programming (ASP) with satisfiability modulo theories (SMT) solvers. First results of an automotive case study demonstrate the applicability of our method for complex real-world applications.},

With the best state-of-the-art cellular systems barely able to meet below-50-ms delays, in this article we propose some important improvements to the 3GPP MTC access procedure allowing a significantly performance boost for alarm messages. Notably, the first method encompasses an SMSlike approach where the alarm is transmitted in a secure and backward-compatible form over the connection-establishing access channel, thus allowing the data transmission to be terminated significantly earlier and to support emerging critical alarm messages. The second method uses a secure and previously agreed sequence of random access codes to convey super-critical alerts within a few milliseconds, and is thus able to support emergency alarm messages. Both methods not only achieve control-compliant access delays but are also highly energy efficient, thus allowing long battery lifetimes and hence quicker uptake by the industry.},

In this paper we present the platform-based synthesis system, named xPilot, being developed at UCLA. The first objective of xPilot is to provide novel behavioral synthesis capability for automatically generating efficient RTL code from a C or SystemC description for a given system platform and optimizing the logic, interconnects, performance, and power simultaneously. The second objective of xPilot is to provide a platform-based system-level synthesis capability, including both synthesis for application-specific configurable processors and heterogeneous multi-core systems. Preliminary experiments on FPGAs demonstrate the efficacy of our approach on a wide range of applications and its value in exploring various design tradeoffs.},

  Abstract                 = {For companies in the automation industry, the development of real-time Ethernet to connect devices is of high economic interest to replace conventional fieldbus systems. Therefore, many approaches for adapting Ethernet to real-time requirements come from industrial applications. This is a chal- lenging task as the original Ethernet standard IEEE 802.3 was not designed for real-time data transmission. Likewise, protocols basing on Ethernet like TCP, UDP, and IP do typically not con- sider real-time requirements. Hence, adaptations on several OSI layers become necessary to make the industrial system meet hard real-time requirements. For this purpose, a multitude of real- time capable Industrial Ethernet systems has been developed, which solve the problems of standard Ethernet- and TCP/IP- or UDP/IP-based communication in a variety of ways. This paper gives a summary of different Industrial Ethernet protocols for the real-time data transmission via Ethernet in automation envi- ronments. Advantages and disadvantages of these protocols are analyzed with regard to their sustainability in terms of their real- time capability, reliability, scalability, self-configuration of the network, and hardware requirements. Against the background of connected devices tremendously growing in number and computational power in the prospective â€œIndustrial Internetâ€?, consequences for future developments are drawn},

  Abstract                 = {The hope that mathematical methods employed in the investigation of formal logic would lead to purely computational methods for obtaining mathematical theorems goes back to Leibniz and has been revived by Peano around the turn of the century and by Hilbert's school in the 1920's. Hilbert, noting that all of classical mathematics could be formalized within quantification theory, declared that the problem of finding an algorithm for determining whether or not a given formula of quantification theory is valid was the central problem of mathematical logic. And indeed, at one time it seemed as if investigations of this â€œdecisionâ€? problem were on the verge of success. However, it was shown by Church and by Turing that such an algorithm can not exist. This result led to considerable pessimism regarding the possibility of using modern digital computers in deciding significant mathematical questions. However, recently there has been a revival of interest in the whole question. Specifically, it has been realized that while no decision procedure exists for quantification theory there are many proof procedures availableâ€”that is, uniform procedures which will ultimately locate a proof for any formula of quantification theory which is valid but which will usually involve seeking â€œforeverâ€? in the case of a formula which is not validâ€”and that some of these proof procedures could well turn out to be feasible for use with modern computing machinery. Hao Wang [9] and P. C. Gilmore [3] have each produced working programs which employ proof procedures in quantification theory. Gilmore's program employs a form of a basic theorem of mathematical logic due to Herbrand, and Wang's makes use of a formulation of quantification theory related to those studied by Gentzen. However, both programs encounter decisive difficulties with any but the simplest formulas of quantification theory, in connection with methods of doing propositional calculus. Wang's program, because of its use of Gentzen-like methods, involves exponentiation on the total number of truth-functional connectives, whereas Gilmore's program, using normal forms, involves exponentiation on the number of clauses present. Both methods are superior in many cases to truth table methods which involve exponentiation on the total number of variables present, and represent important initial contributions, but both run into difficulty with some fairly simple examples. In the present paper, a uniform proof procedure for quantification theory is given which is feasible for use with some rather complicated formulas and which does not ordinarily lead to exponentiation. The superiority of the present procedure over those previously available is indicated in part by the fact that a formula on which Gilmore's routine for the IBM 704 causes the machine to computer for 21 minutes without obtaining a result was worked successfully by hand computation using the present method in 30 minutes. Cf. {\S}6, below. It should be mentioned that, before it can be hoped to employ proof procedures for quantification theory in obtaining proofs of theorems belonging to â€œgenuineâ€? mathematics, finite axiomatizations, which are â€œshort,â€? must be obtained for various branches of mathematics. This last question will not be pursued further here; cf., however, Davis and Putnam [2], where one solution to this problem is given for ele},

  Abstract                 = {Synchronous Dataflow (SDF) is a powerful analysis tool for regular, cyclic, parallel task graphs. The behaviour of SDF graphs however is static and therefore not always able to accurately capture the behaviour of modern, dynamic dataflow applications, such as embedded multimedia codecs. An approach to tackle this limitation is by means of scenarios. In this paper we introduce a technique and a tool to automatically analyse a scenario-aware dataflow model for its worst-case performance. A system is specified as a collection of SDF graphs representing individual scenarios of behaviour and a finite state machine that specifies the possible orders of scenario occurrences. This combination accurately captures more dynamic applications and this way provides tighter results than an existing analysis based on a conservative static dataflow model, which is too pessimistic, while looking only at the {\&}{\#}x2018;worst-case{\&}{\#}x2019; individual scenario, without considering scenario transitions, can be too optimistic. We introduce a formal semantics of the model, in terms of (max; +) linear system-theory and in particular (max; +) automata. Leveraging existing results and algorithms from this domain, we give throughput analysis and state space generation algorithms for worst-case performance analysis. The method is implemented in a tool and the effectiveness of the approach is experimentally evaluated.},

Most recently, many approaches and tools that claim to realize and support a design process at the so-called electronic system level (ESL) have emerged. However, faced with the vast complexity challenges, in most cases at best, only partial solutions are available. In this paper, we develop and propose a novel classification for ESL synthesis tools, and we will present six different academic approaches in this context. Based on these observations, we can identify such common principles and needs as they are leading toward and are ultimately required for a true ESL synthesis solution, covering the whole design process from specification to implementation for complete systems across hardware and software boundaries.},

In this paper, we abstract the primary reliability requirements in typical industrial wireless mesh networks and define three types of reliable routing graphs for different communication purposes. We present efficient algorithms to construct them and describe the recovery mechanisms in the event of component failures. Based on these graphs, data link layer communication schedules are generated to achieve end-to-end real-time performance. We demonstrate through extensive experimental results that our algorithms can achieve highly reliable routing, improved communication latency and stable real-time communication in large-scale networks at the cost of modest overhead in device configuration.},

In this paper, we show that SAT-techniques are also applicable and helpful during the synthesis and the optimization of a system. Therefore, we must consider two questions: (i) how to represent specifications; and (ii) how to quantify properties of embedded systems by boolean formulas. Thus, we reduce the well known binding problem to the Boolean satisfiability problem. Next, we show how to quantify the degree of fault tolerance of a system using quantified Boolean formulas (QBFs). These problems correspond to typical subroutines often used during design space exploration.

We consider robots and automation systems that rely on data or code from a network to support their operation, i.e., where not all sensing, computation, and memory is integrated into a standalone system. This survey is organized around four potential benefits of the Cloud: 1) Big Data: access to libraries of images, maps, trajectories, and descriptive data; 2) Cloud Computing: access to parallel grid computing on demand for statistical analysis, learning, and motion planning; 3) Collective Robot Learning: robots sharing trajectories, control policies, and outcomes; and 4) Human Computation: use of crowdsourcing to tap human skills for analyzing images and video, classification, learning, and error recovery. The Cloud can also improve robots and automation systems by providing access to: a) datasets, publications, models, benchmarks, and simulation tools; b) open competitions for designs and systems; and c) open-source software. This survey includes over 150 references on results and open challenges. A website with new developments and updates is available at: http://goldberg.berkeley.edu/cloud-robotics/.},

  Abstract                 = {Abstractâ€”This paper focuses on the development of a learning- based heuristic for scheduling heterogeneous machines. Although list scheduling methods have been widely used for a large class of scheduling problems, including the heterogeneous machine scheduling problem, they involve designing priority rules, which usually require a fair amount of insights on the characteris- tics of the problem to be solved. Instead of elaborate design of priority rules in a single step, we propose an iterative list scheduling process, which refines priority rules while generating a number of schedules. The proposed iterative list scheduling is formulated as a reinforcement learning problem, with states and actions defined in list scheduling. Due to the large number of possible states, reinforcement learning algorithms which use value functions in constructing an optimal policy may not be suitable for scheduling problems. Thus, to directly work with policies rather than the values of states, we propose genetic reinforcement learning (GRL), in which the policies of reinforcement learning are encoded into the chromosomes of genetic algorithms and a near-optimal policy is searched for by genetic algorithms. A GRL- based scheduler, called evolutionary intracell scheduler (EVIS), has been developed and applied to various scheduling problems such as the heterogeneous machine scheduling, the processor scheduling, the job-shop scheduling, the flow-shop scheduling, and the open-shop scheduling problems. The proposed model of EVIS, which has a linear order of population-fitness convergence, is verified by computer experiments. Even without fine tuning EVIS, the quality of solutions achieved by EVIS is comparable to that of problem-tailored heuristics for most of the problem instances.},

  Abstract                 = {Diversity assessment of Pareto front approximations is an important issue in the stochastic multiobjective optimization community. Most of the diversity indicators in the literature were designed to work for any number of objectives of Pareto front approximations in principle, but in practice many of these indicators are infeasible or not workable when the number of objectives is large. In this paper, we propose a diversity comparison indicator (DCI) to assess the diversity of Pareto front approximations in many-objective optimization. DCI evaluates relative quality of different Pareto front approximations rather than provides an absolute measure of distribution for a single approximation. In DCI, all the concerned approximations are put into a grid environment so that there are some hyperboxes containing one or more solutions. The proposed indicator only considers the contribution of different approximations to nonempty hyperboxes. Therefore, the computational cost does not increase exponentially with the number of objectives. In fact, the implementation of DCI is of quadratic time complexity, which is fully independent of the number of divisions used in grid. Systematic experiments are conducted using three groups of artificial Pareto front approximations and seven groups of real Pareto front approximations with different numbers of objectives to verify the effectiveness of DCI. Moreover, a comparison with two diversity indicators used widely in many-objective optimization is made analytically and empirically. Finally, a parametric investigation reveals interesting insights of the division number in grid and also offers some suggested settings to the users with different preferences.},

  Abstract                 = {The motivation behind the work in very-high-level languages is to ease the programming task by pro-viding the programmer with a language containing primitives or abstractions suitable to his problem area. The programmer is then able to spend his effort in the right place; he concentrates on solving his problem, and the resulting program will be more reliable as a result. Clearly, this is a worthwhile goal. Unfortunately, it is very difficult for a designer to select in advance all the abstractions which the users of his language might need. If a language is to be used at all, it is likely to be used to solve problems which its designer did not envision, and for which the abstractions embedded in the language are not sufficient. This paper presents an approach which allows the set of built-in abstractions to be augmented when the need for a new data abstraction is discovered. This approach to the handling of abstraction is an outgrowth of work on designing a language for structured programming. Relevant aspects of this language are described, and examples of the use and definitions of abstractions are given.},

  Abstract                 = {Task graph scheduling on multiprocessor systems is a representative multiprocessor scheduling problem. A solution to this problem consists of the mapping of tasks to processors and the scheduling of tasks on each processor. Optimal solution can be obtained by exploring the entire design space of all possible mapping and scheduling choices. Since the problem is NP-hard, scalability becomes the main concern in solving the problem optimally. In this paper, a SAT-based optimization framework is proposed to address this problem, in which SAT solver is enhanced by integrating with a scheduling analysis tool in a branch and bound manner to prune the solution space efficiently. Performance evaluation results show that our technique has average performance improvement in more than an order of magnitude compared to state-of-the-art techniques. We further build a cycle-accurate network-on-chip simulator based on SystemC to verify the effectiveness of the proposed technique on realistic multiprocessor systems.},

Namely, all client requests are satisfied in the local datacenter in which they arise; the system efficiently supports useful data model abstractions such as column families and counter columns; and clients can access data in a causally- consistent fashion with read-only and write-only transac- tional support, even for keys spread across many servers. The primary contributions of this work are enabling scalable causal consistency for the complex column- family data model, as well as novel, non-blocking al- gorithms for both read-only and write-only transactions. Our evaluation shows that our system, Eiger, achieves low latency (single-ms), has throughput competitive with eventually-consistent and non-transactional Cassandra (less than 7{\%} overhead for one of Facebook's real-world workloads), and scales out to large clusters almost lin- early (averaging 96{\%} increases up to 128 server clusters).},

The framework provides a symbolic representation that is used by an Integer Linear Programming (ILP) solver to determine a schedule that respects all bus and processor constraints as well as end-to-end timing constraints. Unlike other approaches, the proposed technique complies with automotive specific requirements at system-level and is fully extensible. Formulations for common time-triggered automotive operating systems and bus systems are presented. The proposed model supports the automotive bus systems FlexRay 2.1 and 3.0. For the operating systems, formulations for an eCos-based non-preemptive component and a preemptive OSEKtime operating system are introduced. A case study from the automotive domain gives evidence of the applicability of the proposed approach by scheduling multiple distributed control functions concurrently. Finally, a scalability analysis is carried out with synthetic test cases.},

According to SIGNAL's polychronous model of computation, we propose a model for AADL, which takes both software, hardware and allocation into account. This model enables an early phase timing analysis and synthesis via tools associated with Polychrony.},

With rising data and event rates and with correlations among these events, sequential event processing be- comes infeasible and needs to be distributed. Existing approaches cannot deal with the ubiquity of out-of-order event arrival that is introduced by network delays when distributing EBS. Order-less event processing may result in a system failure. We present a low-latency approach based on K-slack that achieves ordered event processing on high data rate sensor and event streams without a-priori knowledge. Slack buffers are dy- namically adjusted to fit the disorder in the streams without using local or global clocks. The middleware transparently reorders the event input streams so that events can still be aggregated and processed to a granularity that satisfies the demands of the application. On a Realtime Locating System (RTLS) our system performs accurate low-latency event detection under the predominance of out-of-order event arrival and with a close to linear performance scale-up when the system is distributed over several threads and machines.},

  Abstract                 = {Convergecast is a fundamental operation in many wireless sensor network (WSN) applications. When gathering data, power saving and convergecast latency are two main concerns. This work adopts the ZigBee tree networks to address these two concerns. In a ZigBee tree network, to support energy efficient operations, each node is assigned to an active portion (or say slot). A node wakes up at its slot and its parents slot to collect data from its children and to report data to its parent, respectively. Then, it can go to sleep to save energy. To support low latency convergecast, in this work, we propose a centralized and a distributed slot assignment schemes for ZigBee tree networks. We observe that when assigning slots, the latency can be further reduced by reconnecting some tree links. More specifically, by the designed rules, a node is allowed to locally modify some of its neighbors parents, and then the node can be assigned to a better slot that can have the benefit of reducing the nodes report latency. Simulation and implementation results show that the proposed schemes can effectively reduce the convergecast latency in ZigBee tree-based WSNs.},

  Abstract                 = {As we are moving towards the Internet of Things (IoT), the number of sensors deployed around the world is growing at a rapid pace. Market research has shown a significant growth of sensor deployments over the past decade and has predicted a significant increment of the growth rate in the future. These sensors continuously generate enormous amounts of data. However, in order to add value to raw sensor data we need to understand it. Collection, modelling, reasoning, and distribution of context in relation to sensor data plays critical role in this challenge. Context-aware computing has proven to be successful in understanding sensor data. In this paper, we survey context awareness from an IoT perspective. We present the necessary background by introducing the IoT paradigm and context-aware fundamentals at the beginning. Then we provide an in-depth analysis of context life cycle. We evaluate a subset of projects (50) which represent the majority of research and commercial solutions proposed in the field of context-aware computing conducted over the last decade (2001-2011) based on our own taxonomy. Finally, based on our evaluation, we highlight the lessons to be learnt from the past and some possible directions for future research. The survey addresses a broad range of techniques, methods, models, functionalities, systems, applications, and middleware solutions related to context awareness and IoT. Our goal is not only to analyse, compare and consolidate past research work but also to appreciate their findings and discuss their applicability towards the IoT.},

  Abstract                 = {Low latency analytics on geographically distributed dat- asets (across datacenters, edge clusters) is an upcoming and increasingly important challenge. The dominant approach of aggregating all the data to a single data- center significantly inflates the timeliness of analytics. At the same time, running queries over geo-distributed inputs using the current intra-DC analytics frameworks also leads to high query response times because these frameworks cannot cope with the relatively low and variable capacity of WAN links. We present Iridium, a system for low latency geo-distri- buted analytics. Iridium achieves low query response times by optimizing placement of both data and tasks of the queries. The joint data and task placement op- timization, however, is intractable. Therefore, Iridium uses an online heuristic to redistribute datasets among the sites prior to queries' arrivals, and places the tasks to reduce network bottlenecks during the query's ex- ecution. Finally, it also contains a knob to budget WAN usage. Evaluation across eight worldwide EC2 re- gions using production queries show that Iridium speeds up queries by 3Ã— âˆ’ 19Ã— and lowers WAN usage by 15{\%}âˆ’64{\%} compared to existing baselines.},

  Abstract                 = {Due to the ever increasing system complexity, deciding whether a given platform is sufficient to implement a set of applications under given constraints becomes a serious bottleneck in platform-based design. As a remedy, the work at hand proposes a novel automatic platform-based system synthesis procedure, inspired by techniques developed in the context of automatic system verification known as Satisfiability Modulo Theories. It tightly couples the computation of a feasible allocation and binding with nonfunctional constraint checking where, in contrast to existing approaches, not only linear constraints but even nonlinear constraints are supported. This allows to efficiently prove whether there exists a feasible implementation of a set of applications on the given platform with respect to both, functional and nonfunctional constraints. Moreover, an approach for early learning based on feasibility checking of partial implementations is proposed that can significantly improve the synthesis runtime, especially in case the selected platform imposes stringent constraints on the implementation. The effectiveness of this approach is shown for an automotive ECU network design that requires Modular Performance Analysis to ensure nonfunctional nonlinear timing constraints.},

  Abstract                 = {The design of new consumer electronics devices is getting more and more complex as more functionality is integrated into these devices. To manage the design complexity, a predictable design flow is needed. The result should be a system that guarantees that an application can perform its own tasks within strict timing deadlines, independent of other applications running on the system. This requires that the timing behavior of the hardware, the software, as well as their interaction can be predicted. A heterogeneous multi-processor System-on-Chip (MP-SoC) is often men- tioned as the hardware platform to be used in modern electronics systems. An MP-SoC offers good potential for computational efficiency (operations per Joule) for many applications. Networks-on-Chip (NoCs) are proposed as interconnect in these systems. A NoC offers scalability and guarantees on the timing behav- ior when communicating data between various processing and storage elements. Combining this with a predictable resource arbitration strategy for the processors and storage elements gives a predictable platform. To obtain a fully predictable system, also the timing behavior and resource usage of an application mapped to such an MP-SoC platform needs to be analyzable and predictable. The Syn- chronous Dataflow (SDF) model of computation fits well with the characteristics of streaming applications, it can capture many mapping decisions, and it allows design-time analysis of timing and resource usage. Therefore, this thesis aims to achieve predictable, streaming application behavior on NoC-based MP-SoC platforms for applications modeled as SDF graphs (SDFGs). The most important timing requirement for streaming applications is usually related to the throughput that should be achieved. A major aspect influencing the achievable throughput, and in fact also the computational efficiency, is the storage space allocated to the data streams being processed in the system. In an SDFG model, the edges in the graph typically correspond to data streams. The storage allocation problem for an SDFG is the problem of assigning a fixed storage size to its edges. This size must be chosen such that the throughput requirement of the system is met, while minimizing the required storage space. The first major contribution of this thesis is an exact technique to explore the throughput/storage-space trade-off space. Despite the theoretical complexity of the storage allocation problem, the technique performs well in practice. By con- sidering the entire trade-off space, it is possible to cope with situations where the precise throughput constraint is not (yet) known or might dynamically change. In multi-processor mapping, for example, scheduling decisions can influence the achievable throughput. This introduces uncertainty on the relation between the throughput and the storage requirements of an SDFG in the early phases of the trajectory when these scheduling decisions are not yet made. In any multi-processor mapping trajectory, an application must be bound to and scheduled onto the processors and storage elements in the MP-SoC. An important contribution of this thesis is such a technique to bind and schedule an SDFG onto anMP-SoC. Existing binding and scheduling techniques can only deal with single-rate execution dependencies between tasks. SDFGs can express multi- rate dependencies between tasks. Dependencies in an SDFG can be expressed in single-rate form, but then the problem size may increase exponentially making the binding and scheduling infeasible. The binding and scheduling technique presented in this thesis works directly on SDFGs, building on an efficient technique to calculate throughput of a bound and scheduled SDFG. When the application tasks have been bound to and scheduled onto the plat- form components, it remains to schedule the communication onto the MP-SoC interconnect. This thesis presents three different scheduling strategies that sched- ule time-constrained communications on a NoC while minimizing resource usage by exploiting all scheduling freedom offered by NoCs. It is shown that these strategies outperform existing NoC scheduling techniques. Furthermore, a tech- nique is presented to extract the timing constraints on the communication from a bound and scheduled SDFG, connecting the NoC scheduling strategies to the binding and scheduling strategy for SDFGs mentioned earlier. Finally, the techniques presented in this thesis are embedded into a coherent design flow. The starting point is a streaming application that is modeled with an SDFG and a NoC-based MP-SoC that offers a predictable timing behavior. The objective of the flow is to minimize the resource usage while offering guaran- tees on the timing behavior, in practice the throughput, of the application when mapped to the system. A case study is performed that maps a set of multime- dia applications (H.263 encoder/decoder and an MP3 decoder) onto a NoC-based MP-SoC. It shows that the design flow, SDFG mapping techniques, and SDFG analysis techniques presented in this thesis enable a mapping of a streaming ap- plication onto a NoC-based architecture that has a predictable timing behavior. This makes it the first complete design flow that maps a time-constrained SDFG to a NoC-based MP-SoC while providing throughput guarantees.},

  Abstract                 = {Applying wireless technologies in control systems can significantly enhance the system mobility and reduce the deployment and maintenance cost. Existing wireless technology standards, however either cannot provide real-time guarantee on packet delivery or are not fast enough to support high-speed control systems which typically require 1kHz or higher sampling rate. Nondeterministic packet transmission and insufficiently high sampling rate will severely hurt the control performance. To address this problem, in this paper, we present our design and implementation of a real-time high-speed wireless communication protocol called RT-WiFi. RT-WiFi is a TDMA data link layer protocol based on IEEE 802.11 physical layer to provide deterministic timing guarantee on packet delivery and high sampling rate up to 6kHz. It incorporates configurable components for adjusting design trade-offs including sampling rate, latency variance, reliability, and compatibility to existing Wi-Fi networks, thus can serve as an ideal communication platform for supporting a wide range of high-speed wireless control systems. We implemented RT-WiFi on commercial off-the-shelf hardware and integrated it into a mobile gait rehabilitation system. Our extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of RT-WiFi in providing deterministic packet delivery in both data link layer and application layer, which further eases the controller design and significantly improve the control performance.},

  Abstract                 = {Choosing the right programming model for multiprocessor System-on-Chip (MPSoC) platforms is a challenging task: in order to provide for automatic hardware/software synthesis in a model-based design flow, the system model should be architecture-independent on the one hand, but should also allow the back-annotation of architecture-dependent mapping and scheduling decisions on the other hand. Here, architecture-independent dataflow models are particularly suitable. In a dataflow model, concurrent processes (actors) communicate via packets transmitted over channels. However, the back-annotation process is difficult, and previous approaches are either restricted to static dataflow actors or static schedules. Also, the semantics of the underlying dataflow actors are often different from the semantics of the scheduling mechanism, which limits the compositionality of the dataflow model. In this paper, we propose a modeling approach which unifies the representation of dataflow actors and scheduling mechanisms, while also providing for both, dynamic dataflow actors and dynamic scheduling decisions. We describe how various scheduling schemes can be represented by our approach, and show the applicability of the proposed approach by means of synthetic dataflow graphs.},

  Abstract                 = {Currently, users of geo-distributed storage systems face a hard choice between having serializable transactions with high latency, or limited or no transactions with low latency. We show that it is possible to obtain both serial- izable transactions and low latency, under two conditions. First, transactions are known ahead of time, permitting an a priori static analysis of conflicts. Second, transac- tions are structured as transaction chains consisting of a sequence of hops, each hop modifying data at one server. To demonstrate this idea, we built Lynx, a geo-distributed storage system that offers transaction chains, secondary indexes, materialized join views, and geo-replication. Lynx uses static analysis to determine if each hop can execute separately while preserving serializabilityâ€”if so, a client needs wait only for the first hop to complete, which occurs quickly. To evaluate Lynx, we built three applications: an auction service, a Twitter-like microblog- ging site and a social networking site. These applications successfully use chains to achieve low latency operation and good throughput.},

  Abstract                 = {This article presents a multiprocessor system-on-chip synthesis (MPSoC) algorithm that optimizes system mean time to failure. Given a set of directed acyclic periodic graphs of communicating tasks, the proposed algorithm determines a processor core allocation, level of system-level and processor-level structural redundancy, assignment of tasks to processors, floorplan, and schedule in order to minimize system failure rate and area while meeting functionality and timing constraints. Changes to the thermal profile resulting from changes in allocation, assignment, scheduling, and floorplan are modeled and optimized during synthesis, as is the impact of thermal profile on temperature-dependent failure mechanisms. The proposed techniques have the potential to substantially increase MPSoC system mean time to failure compared to area-optimized solutions. If power densities are high and the dominant lifetime failure mechanisms are strongly dependent on temperature, our results indicate that thermal and structural redundancy optimization during synthesis have the potential to greatly increase MPSoC lifetime with low area cost.},
