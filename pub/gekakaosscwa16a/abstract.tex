\begin{abstract}
Answer Set Programming (ASP) is a model, ground, and solve paradigm.
The integration of application- or theory-specific reasoning into ASP systems thus impacts on many if not all elements of its workflow,
viz.\
input language,
grounding,
intermediate language,
solving, and
output format.
%
We address this challenge with the fifth generation of the ASP system \clingo\ and its grounding and solving components
by equipping them with well-defined generic interfaces facilitating the manifold integration efforts.
%
On the grounder's side, we introduce a generic way of specifying language extensions and 
propose an intermediate format accommodating their ground representation.
At the solver end, this is accompanied by high-level interfaces 
easing the integration of theory propagators dealing with these extensions.
